            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>THE CLIMB: A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</div><div><strong><br></strong>A few months ago, I was standing on the drive of a hacienda somewhere outside Latacunga in Ecuador.This drive was a few hundred metres long and I was wondering why people needed such a long drive in times of horse and cart.The car was ready and we left for the national park where the almighty volcano Cotopaxi is.
</div><div><br></div><div>That morning it was quite foggy and cold. We drove for about an hour on the highway before we arrived at the entrance of the national park. The we drove for about one hour uphill in between eucalyptus trees. The smell was so intense and fresh, ... something you do not expect at a height of 3800 metres. Eventually, we arrived on a flat area where the roadsigns were replaced by warning signs of pyroclastic flows and mud streams. The immense surroundings were covered with lava fragments of a former outburst of the volcano. Stones as big as a hand palm, others bigger than a mini van. That particular morning the fog was not lifting yet but once in a while there was an opening in the layer of clouds that showed us the peak of the Cotopaxi..In my life I never saw something that was so big and so intimidating.In fact, you nearly had to bend your neck some 90 degrees in order to have a good look at the top. We drove zigzagging uphill for another few kilometres before we reached the actual parking place. On the parking there were two other cars: a white van and an old yellow Renault sports car. People were having a picnic in the freezing cold with wind speeds of some 90 km/h.
</div><div><br></div><div>Together with the guide I headed for the refuge some 500 metres uphill. We could two paths. The one at the right was the shortest, however the most exhausting one. This path led straight to the refuge, with a slope of some 40 degrees. The left one went zigzagging and would take us another hour to reach the refuge. Without hesitation we went for the left one. This would allow me better to absorb the view on the way up. The howling wind froze my ears and my sight was blocked by the fog and the cold air. All this caused me a neverending pain, i.e. as long as I was in the outdoor.
</div><div><br></div><div>My thoughts switched to nostalgic moments in my life. I was thinking about those people who were the most precious in my life and about everything I loved. This truly helped me to go on, as if my head switched to survival mode.This first climb was the most extreme I experienced so far in my life.
</div><div><br></div><div>After some 25 minutes, we arrived at the refuge. The guide congratulated me because up till now, he only met few people able to do it in such a short time. He also added that with my physical condition, I should be able to reach the top. He had no idea whatsoever how great it was for me to hear this., because one of my biggest dreams is to reach the top of the Cotopaxi.We went inside the refuge , ... we warmed ourselves by means of a cup of hot chocolate. I spoke with a guy from Australia who told me that at present the top was a no-go zone. The volcano currently was in an active mode. Maybe the pths up were to open again in a few weeks. I didn't mind because this gave me a reason to come back in order to realize my dream.
</div><div><br></div><div>There I was at 4864 metres on our planet. Like the slogan of the volcano goes: 4864 metres closer to the moon. The volcano is also called the neck of the moon by the Quichua people. I stepped outside without my guide and let everything absorb me. The strong wind was still there, but the pain was gone. I felt like one of the characters in the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich looked on at their back in absolutely magnificent and mysterious landscapes.. Just like his characters? I looked back at the path I took. At that very moment, I felt like the walker above the mist. I still perfectly recall the images. Anyhow, this was one of the most important moments of my life when I look back at it. I was, as the pilosophers of the 18th century would call it, 'in the sublime'.
